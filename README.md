# Convolutional-neural-network-for-image-classification

This repository contains image classification by convolutional neural network with intel data provided from kaggle.
The data contains 6 categorical images as buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. It is divided into training set,
     test set and prediction set.
     
The code for the dataset is as below.

Two seperate files have been added for preprocessing of training and testing dataset. 
Also code for saving the processed dataset interms of features and labels as X and y has been added.
In the third file with title of "Training and testing of Convolutional neural network", the convolutional model is trained 
     and tested. Also the code for saving the code of keras model with optimum result has been added.
